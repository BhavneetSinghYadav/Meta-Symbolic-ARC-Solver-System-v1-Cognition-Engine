# Meta-Symbolic ARC Solver System



Scripts located in `arc_solver/scripts` serve as entrypoints for running the solver, training search models and visualizing traces. Configuration files are stored in `arc_solver/configs` while experiment results and notebooks live in their respective directories.

Basic unit tests are included under `arc_solver/tests` and can be run with `pytest`.

For a high level view of how the solver components interact, see
[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).
